The CSV files show examples of runtimes, some of which were averaged and used for the numbers given in my blog post.
To give a sense of the format of these CSVs, I've also included the helper scripts which I used to launch the actual workflows over various datasets.
Note though, that the versions of the scripts used to obtain this data were not exactly the same as the ones listed here as examples and relied more on parameters to run everything smoothly.
